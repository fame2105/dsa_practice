Generating Random Number in Java

In Java, there is three-way to generate random numbers using the method and classes.

    1.Using the random() Method
    2.Using the Random Class
    3.Using the ThreadLocalRandom Class
    4.Using the ints() Method (in Java 8)

1. random():
random() is a static method in Math class.
It generates only double type random number greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0

We can also use the following formula if we want to a generate random number between a specified range:
Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min
 note : the min value is inclusive while the max value is exclusive.

2. java.util.Random :
We can generate a random number of any data type, such as integer, float, double, Boolean, long.
If you are going to use this class to generate random numbers, follow the steps given below:

    First, import the class java.lang.Random.
    Create an object of the Random class.
    Invoke any of the following methods:
    nextInt(int bound) // accepts a parameter bound (upper) that must be positive. 0 to bound(upper)
    nextInt()
    nextFloat() // generates random value between 0.0 and 1.0
    nextDouble() // generates random value between 0.0 and 1.0
    nextLong()
    nextBoolean()

3. java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom :
note: It is impossible to share a ThreadLocalRandom with multiple threads accidentally.

    To to use this class for generating random numbers, follow the steps given below:

    First, import the class by using java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom.
    Invoke the corresponding method for which you want to generate numbers randomly.
    nextInt()
    nextDouble()
    nextLong()
    nextFloat()
    nextBoolean()

    All the above methods override the corresponding method of the Random class

    nextInt(int bound) // range : 0 to bound-1
    nextDouble(int bound) // range : 0 to bound-1
    nextLong(int bound) // range : 0 to bound-1

    note : bound must always be positive.

    nextInt(int origin, int bound) // range: origin (inclusive) to bound (exclusive)
    nextDouble(int origin, int bound) // range: origin (inclusive) to bound (exclusive)
    nextLong(int origin, int bound) // range: origin (inclusive) to bound (exclusive)

4. ints():
 In Java 8, a new method ints() has been added to the Random class.
 We must import the java.util.Random before using the method.

 ints(long streamSize, int randomNumberOrigin, int randomNumberBound):

 It throws IllegalArgumentException if:
      streamSize < 0
      origin > = bound

      Similarly, we can also generate the stream of long and double types by using the longs() and doubles().
