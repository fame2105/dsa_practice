Using Decorator Pattern, we avoid
1. Redundant Code
2. Class Explosion

Relevant Examples : 1. CoffeeShop (Base Coffee with tremendous amount of Toppings)
                    2. PizzaShop (This Example)
                    3. CarManufacturing(Base Car with many Features... FeatureDecorator on Base Car)

Decorator Pattern is an efficient way of wrapping a base object with multiple features instead of creating too many classes with
redundant code.
