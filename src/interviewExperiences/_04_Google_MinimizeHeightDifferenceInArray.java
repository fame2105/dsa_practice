You are the in-charge of the planning of the reconstruction of your city. As per the guidelines, you need to ensure that all the buildings in the city are of the same height,
which is defined by the number of floors. You are aware of the current heights of all the buildings. To make all buildings of equal height, you can remove some of the floors from any of the buildings.
Post removal, if there are no floors left in the building, then the plot will be used for community services (car parking, playing area, etc).

Given the number of floors in each building, devise an algorithm to make the building heights equal in such a way that the total number of floors removed from the city is minimized.

[2, 7, 4, 6] 2 floors need to be removed, use building at 0 for parking

Find the number of floors in final ans X = 4
1.

[1, 2, 10000] X = 2 [0, 0, 998]


[0, 4, 4, 4, 0]
